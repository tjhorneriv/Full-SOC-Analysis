# Full-SOC-Analysis

In this project, I acted as a security engineer supporting an organization's SOC infrastructure. The scenario was that the SOC analysts had noticed some discrepancies
with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager had asked me to investigate this issue.

WORK IN PROGRESS!!!
