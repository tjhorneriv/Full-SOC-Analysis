# Full-SOC-Analysis

In this project I assumed the role of a security engineer supporting an organization's SOC infrastructure. The scenario was that SOC analysts had noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager asked the security engineering team to investigate and confirm that the newly created alerts were working.

Once confirming that the alerts were working, I was then instructed to monitor live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that aren't reflected in the alerting system. I then reported my findings to the manager with my analysis. This was demonstrated by presenting my findings in a presentation.

I created this diagram to explain the network setup that was used for this project.
